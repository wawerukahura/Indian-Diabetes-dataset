Diabetes tree based methods Case study

1.1 Context

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. This Repository shows detailed EDA performed on the dataset as well as builds a model for predicting a Diabetic patient such as calculation of the Performance Metrics :- Confusion Matrix, F1 Score, Precision Score, Recall Score
